			<h1>Kevin Wayne Rusch</h1></br>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">I'm a Cuban-born, German-bred, US-based computational cognitive neuroscientist with backgrounds in biochemistry and computational modeling.<br><br>I'm currently working as a Bioinformatician (II) doing computational neuroscience at the University of Massachusetts' <a href="https://www.yeminilab.com/">Yemini Lab</a>, where I'm working on using transformer-based architectures to facilitate neuron-level detection and tracking in C. Elegans. I also work as a Research Project Manager at the <a href="http://kordinglab.com/">Kording Lab</a> at the University of Pennsylvania. Hired under the <a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/current-research/trans-agency-activities/rigor-transparency/initiative-improve-education-principles-rigorous-research">CENTER</a> grant, most of my work there revolves around metascience and specifically rigor in scientific research.<br><br>Beyond that, I also serve on the executive committee of <a href="https://neuromatch.io/">Neuromatch Academy</a>, I run the biggest <a href="https://reddit.com/r/neuroscience">online community</a> of neuroscience researchers, students, and enthusiasts, and I've been a Science & Tech contributor for some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220105070931/https://thecommonernews.com/launch-of-james-webb-space-telescope-heralds-new-capabilities-in-humanitys-study-of-the-early-universe/">non-profit outlets</a>.<br><br>My past research includes thesis work on the cortical dynamics of consciousness and perception at the University of Cambridgeâ€™s <a href="https://www.psychol.cam.ac.uk/research/groups/bekinschtein-laboratory-consciousness-and-cognition">Consciousness and Cognition Laboratory</a> and dynamical modeling of sensorimotor processing in M1 and S1 using preferential subspace identification at the <a href="https://moxonlab.bme.ucdavis.edu/">Neurorobotics Laboratory</a> at UC Davis, where I was also a member of the <a href="https://diversity.ucdavis.edu/">Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee</a>.

<p style="text-align:justify;">This website is mostly meant to host my CV and my art, but over time it has become one of those things where I'll get bored every now and then and add a new section that really doesn't need to be here. Don't be surprised if I use this as a Goodreads replacement or something.</p>
