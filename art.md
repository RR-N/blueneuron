			<h1>Art & Art History</h1><br>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">I’m a major art history enthusiast, particularly when it comes to the baroque movement (from Roman architecture & sculpture to the dutch golden age and flemish baroque paintings), but love art of all kinds. Some of my favorite works include Bernini’s Ecstasy of Saint Teresa, his Saint Longinus, Gude and Tidemand’s Bridal Procession on the Hardangerfjord, Van Gogh's Irises, and both Klimt’s The Kiss and his Musik I. On the more modern side I really love the art of Hockney, Rothko, Gerhard Richter, Bacon, and Basquiat, as well as what I've seen of Richard Serra's, Jacky Connolly's, and Barbara Kruger's work (I admittedly disliked word art until I saw the Kruger exhibition at LACMA.)<br><br>I also like to do some art of my own -- you can see some of it below -- and actually used to do graphic design commissions back when I was in undergrad. These days I tend to prefer sketching with charcoal and painting gouache (on kraft), and sometimes oil (on canvas). <br><br>(And yes, that's a cropped and flipped Mulholland Drive on the left. I really wanted to put it on here as it's my favorite Hockney, but no matter how much I pad this text, it's just too damn long to fit without looking awkward, and I don't want this page to be the only one with a horizontal image, so...)
