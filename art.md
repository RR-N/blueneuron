			<h1>Art & Art History</h1><br>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">I’m a major art history enthusiast, particularly when it comes to the baroque movement (from Ribera to Velazquez, Bernini to Duquesnoy, the dutch golden age to flemish baroque painting),  but love art of all kinds. Some of my favorite works include Bernini’s Ecstasy of Saint Teresa, Gude and Tidemand’s Bridal Procession on the Hardangerfjord, Van Gogh's Irises, and both Klimt’s The Kiss and his Musik I.<br><br>On the more modern side I really love the art of Hockney, Rothko, Gerhard Richter, Bacon, and Basquiat, as well as what I've seen of Barbara Kruger's work, whose LACMA exhibition really turned me around on word art. Jacky Connolly is wicked. I'm also a big fan of music posters, think Victor Moscoso, Rick Griffin, and Frank Kozik.<br><br>I also like to do some art of my own, mostly exploring figures, time, and abstraction. I draw a lot of inspiration from artists alike Bacon and Kanevsky. These days I tend to prefer sketching with charcoal, painting gouache on kraft, and sometimes oil on canvas.
