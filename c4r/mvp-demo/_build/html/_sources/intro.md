# Formulating Valid Research Questions
(Lab Meeting Version)

**What you should already know:**

Learners should be familiar with the archetypal “scientific process” prior to beginning this unit. No other previous units are required.

**What you will have learned by the end of this:**

1. How to decompose a research question into "who"/"what"/"why"/"how".
2. How to write a defined research question using the "who"/"what"/"why"/"how" framework.
3. How to evaluate and improve on research questions using the FINER framework.

```{admonition} A Note on Definitions:
In this unit, we may use "research question", "research study", and "abstract" somewhat interchangeably. These are not always the same thing, so here's a quick guide!

- A **research question** is a question that motivates the design and execution of a research study.
- A **research study** is an experiment or set of closely-related experiments that address a specific research question.
- An **abstract** is the written section of a research publication that summarizes a research study.
