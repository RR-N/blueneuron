			<h1>Travel</h1><br>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">There aren't many better ways to spend your time on earth than by traveling and experiencing what the world has to offer -- its cultures, its nature, its people, and the experiences they each enable -- and it's thus always been a great passion of mine.<br><br>It's arguably in my blood, too: I was born in the West Indies and raised in Germany and Austria by world-traveling parents that ensured that we never go too long without exploring another country, from Swedish ports to Italian beaches and Spanish fincas to Romanian mountains.<br><br>I'm very privileged to have enjoyed the means to travel in adulthood, too. In the pre-COVID months of 2020 alone, I visited Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, and South Africa (staying in the latter for a month), all while living in London. I've also gotten to see much of the US: I've lived in Florida, New York City, Boston, and California, and turned my move back to the east coast into a month-long road trip of the US, hitting up over a dozen states.<br><br>

	<h3>Pictures</h3>
	<p style="text-align:justify;">Now, I honestly don't know why anyone would want to see some random guy's travel pictures, but I'll probably upload a bunch of mine here sooner or later. In the meantime, curious weirdos will have to make due with <a href="https://imgur.com/a/5fpm0rt">a quick Imgur album</a> of whatever I have on my laptop at the time of writing.</p>
