			<h1>Hobbies</h1><br>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">I really donâ€™t have enough time to justify wasting so much of it, but what's a living without a life, right? My two biggest hobbies are art and chess, and I like to try my hand at both at least a couple of times a week. Beyond that, I'm also a major politics/news junkie -- love to burn through substacks and think tank panels in my downtime, and probably indulge in more punditry podcasts than I really should. Knowledge is power, is my excuse.<br><br>Speaking of knowledge, I would <i>love</i> to know why you -- or anyone -- would want to read about some stranger's hobbies on their website. You realize this is only a step or two away from reading your neighbor's LinkedIn?<br><br>Anyway, I also like reading, philosophy, writing, foreign affairs, traveling, and drugs.
