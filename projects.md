			<h1>Projects</h1><br>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">There are a bunch of things I’ve done and organizations I’m involved with that I think of very differently than I do a hobby, whether it’s because I’m more dedicated to these projects or because I just think that they're more worthwhile pursuits. Some of them are fond memories, others are things I engage with on a daily basis -- workshops are more of the former, Neuromatch Academy more of the latter, for example.<br><br>Anyway, I'm sure you get the idea, so just go ahead and click on a heading above.
